          <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
          <h4>Terms of Use :</h4>
          <p>RealAuto.in (collectively, the "Site") owned and operated by Active Digital Technology and its affiliates ("RealAuto", the "Company", "we", or "us"). The Site's access to 
and use is subject to these terms and conditions ("Terms of Use").</p>
          
<p>When you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity ("Company"), you agree to all the terms on that Company and represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind it. 
In this case, the terms "you" and "your" refer to both you and the Company.
</p>

<h4>Subscription and Pricing :</h4>
<p>When you register an account, you will receive a free version for which no credit/debit card details or payment will be required. The free version is for lifetime access, but 
services are limited.</p>
<p>Charges will apply if you choose the subscription plan. Subscription fees apply to upgrades from the free version. The payment method will be by credit card, debit card, Net Banking 
and UPI in total in the relevant currency of choice for the desired Subscription Plan (unless otherwise agreed upon at our discretion). This fee is in effect for the Subscription Term, 
which provides access to all the features.
</p>
<p>When you pay by credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card or bank account for all fees payable during the Subscription Term. Additionally, you consent to share your 
payment information with third parties to process payments.
</p>
<p>The amount and frequency of your subscription will automatically renew according to the Subscription Plan you select (e.g. each month, annually or at any other time). 
Subscriptions cannot be refunded once they have been made. If you choose 
to cancel your RealAuto membership, you may do so at any time without being charged. Once you cancel, there will be no additional charges for your membership. Your membership will 
remain active until the end of the current subscription period, even if you decide to cancel it.</p>


<h4>Data and Privacy :</h4>
<p>Creating an account requires providing contact information, such as your name, email address, and phone number. This information will be used to confirm, secure, and access your 
account. As part of ensuring you are logged in, cookies are used on the website and similar tokens inside the application. Your IP address and other technical information may also be 
stored in memory or in log files by our server software.
</p>
<p>These leads data, along with the other data and contact information submitted by or on your behalf to the RealAuto Services, including electronic data and information provided 
through the use of third-party applications, or collected and processed automatically by the RealAuto Services are collectively referred to as "Your Data".
</p>
<p>As part of our service delivery and maintenance, your User Data may be used for troubleshooting, data analytics, testing, research, statistical analysis, and survey purposes. We may 
also use your data to contact and provide you with services you have requested, create new Services, provide you with features that are relevant to you, and keep our business, 
services, and customers safe and secure.
</p>
<p>We may have to release Your Data if we are required to do so by law, such as when we have a subpoena or court order, to enforce our legal obligations, defend ourselves against legal 
claims, or investigate or prevent actions against illegal activities, such as suspected fraud or abuse or violations of our policies. Each request is carefully examined to ensure that 
they are legal and subject to the legal requirements.
</p>
<p>You will always be in complete control of your data and can decide what to do with it at any time. RealAuto will never sell, share, or disclose your data with third parties unless 
it is necessary for the Services or legally required to do so.
</p>
<p >In the event of your dissatisfaction with this Agreement for any reason or no reason at all, you can contact us at support@realauto.in to securely delete your Data 
and Services account. You can store the deleted information in backups for up to 90 days. Data backups are encrypted and only accessed when disaster recovery is necessary.

<h4>Protection of data :</h4>
<p >The Data we collect from you is protected using various resources, including TLS 1.2 via HTTPS and 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in the database.</p>

<h4>Account Security :</h4>

access to your OTP code(s) for multiple device logins.
</p>

<h4>Services provided by Third Parties :</h4>
<p>RealAuto also provides features and/or functionality that interface with third-party online services ("Third-Party Services"), according to agreements between RealAuto and such 
Third-Party Services (such agreements, "Third-Party Agreements" and such operators, "Operators") or through another means of interoperability that are generally available from the 
Operators ("Third-Party APIs"), over which RealAuto has no control.</p>

<h4>No Unlawful and Prohibited Uses :</h4>
<p>As the condition for your usage of the Service, you agree not to use the Service to serve any illegal or other purposes prohibited by this Agreement. You are not permitted to use 
this Service in any way that, at our sole discretion, may cause damage, disablement or impair the performance of, overload, damage or hinder any other user's use of it. You are not 
permitted to obtain the Service or try to get any material or information by any means that you do not intend to make available through the Service.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, you agree not to provide false or inaccurate information to your account. You acknowledge that we have the right to terminate any account that we consider (in the sole 
discretion) is misleading or false (including profiles that portray an individual or a third party).
</p>

<h4>Modifications and cancellations of services :</h4>
<p>We reserve the right to modify, update or discontinue our Services, or any feature or portion thereof, without prior notice. If you violate the Terms, we may immediately suspend or 
terminate your right to access our Services without notice, obligation, or liability.

<h4>Limitation of Liability :</h4>

</p>
<p>We intend to provide notice of any such claim, suit, or action ("Claim"), to the contact information we have on record for your account (provided, however, that the failure to 
deliver notice shall not reduce your indemnification obligations under this Agreement).</p>

<h4>Disputes :</h4>
<p>The Terms of Use and any disputes arising from or relating to the Site will be governed and construed according to Indian Law (without regard to principles of conflict of laws). The 
parties irrevocably agree that the courts in Indian Soil will have exclusive jurisdiction and venue in any disputes.

or claim is permanently barred. You agree to absolve such a claim within a year of the date on which it was filed.
</p>

<h4>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction :</h4>
<p>The Indian laws apply to this document without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. </p>
<p>Data privacy laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so different rules may apply to Your Data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.
</p>

<h4>Entire Agreement :</h4>
<p>These Terms of Service include your entire understanding and agreement with RealAuto with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, 
or representations and warranties, whether written or oral, relating to said Site.
